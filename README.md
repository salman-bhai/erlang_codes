## CONTRIBUTING

### Procedure for Contributing Code

1. If you are looking to improve Erlang Codes, go to the Issue Tracker and create an Issue! After you've done that, the admin will assign that Issue to you and you can get started working on an implementation. If it already exists, try making it better!

2. Fork the project to your GitHub account and clone the project to your local repository using `git clone`. Kindly **do not do Download ZIP** as pushing the files is more tougher after that!

3. After cloning the project, create a branch in the language that you are planning to implement using `git checkout -b <your-name>-patch` and then implementing your changes.

4. To commit your changes run the following code:
```bash
git add ---all
git commit -m "<Your commit message>"
```

5. Once you are ready to push your changes, you can do so using `git push origin <your-name>-patch`.

6. After that go to the forked repository and send a Pull Request to the Erlang Codes repository. In the Pull Request description, kindly mention all the changes that you've done!
